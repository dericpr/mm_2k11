So you've already registered but you can't login yet?  What GIVES!  Well, the process of registering isn't fully automated, one of the admins needs to setup some stuff for your account on the back-end.  Until that's been done you won't be able to login to the site.  Please take this opportunity to explore our blog and start preparing yourself for the awesome you'll soon experience.  Thank you for your patience, an email is on the way, I PROMISE!
